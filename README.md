# 📊 CSV File Comparator – Boosting Efficiency in Functional Testing

This project was created to help compare CSV files quickly and accurately during functional testing of web applications.

## ✅ Why this tool?

As a QA, I often needed to validate data exports and reports in CSV format. Manually comparing files was time-consuming and error-prone — so I built this tool to make the process faster and more reliable.

## 🚀 Key Benefits

- **Speed**: Quickly compare large CSV files and find differences in seconds.
- **Reliability**: Eliminate manual mistakes and ensure data accuracy.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use and integrate into your testing workflow.
- **Reusability**: Useful across different projects and QA scenarios.

## 💡 Ideal For

- Validating system-generated CSV reports.
- Comparing test outputs vs. expected data.
- Checking data consistency across environments.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your two CSV files in the project folder.
3. Run the script or use the provided command to compare them.
4. Review the output for differences.

> Built by a QA, for QAs — to save time and boost confidence in test results.
